1. Load Capacity
Primary Vertical Load: 3,000 N (≈ 300 kg mass-equivalent)
Lateral (Horizontal) Load: 300 N (to simulate minor side loads/wind or a person leaning).
The baseplate must safely carry these loads concurrently with Factor of Safety (FOS) ≥ 2.
2. Dimensions & Mounting
Maximum Plate Footprint: 200 mm × 200 mm (students can design a shape within this envelope—square, rectangular, circular, etc.).
Plate Thickness: Up to 10 mm max (to control weight and material usage).
The baseplate must have four (4) mounting holes to accommodate M10 bolts (or equivalent fasteners).
Mounting hole pattern (i.e., center-to-center spacing) should fit within the 200×200 mm footprint and be arranged to ensure stability.
3. Deflection Constraint : 
Under the maximum expected load (vertical + lateral), the top surface of the baseplate should not deflect more than 0.5 mm at the center or post location.
4. Weight & Cost : 
The baseplate should weigh no more than 3 kg to simplify handling.
Aim for an estimated material cost ≤ $20 in moderate production volumes.
5. Manufacturability : 
Design the plate so it can be easily fabricated using standard sheet metal or plate processes (laser cutting, waterjet cutting, drilling, etc.).
Keep geometry straightforward to minimize complexity in machining or cutting.
6. Safety & Installation : 
No sharp edges; corners should be rounded or chamfered to reduce injury risk.
Ensure bolt holes are robust enough (i.e., enough edge distance) to avoid tearing out under load.
Include at least one mounting reference (e.g., a center hole or a marked reference) to help position the column or post consistently.
