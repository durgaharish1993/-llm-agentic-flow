1. Design Plan: How would the design be created and what all does the engineer / engineering team need to do to design and manufacture the required part(s).
2. Requirements table: Aka a list of requirements elucidated individually in a tabular format
3. Create Automatable CAD Scripts: Develop at least three distinct baseplate designs using a 3D CAD software package (SolidWorks, Autodesk, Fusion 360, Openscad, Freecad, Onshape).
4. Analysis: 
4.1. Propose the material selected
4.2. Conduct structural analysis for each design and provide a report summarizing the results, including stress calculations, deflection analysis, and safety factor verification.
4.3. Conduct Safety and Failure Analysis
4.4. Propose the relevant applicable standards
5. Test Plan(s) and Test case generation to evaluate the proposed design(s).
6. Manufacturing process recommendation (e.g. 3D printing or CNC or molding etc?)
7. Design Justification Report: Provide a comprehensive report justifying the design choices for each concept, including material selection, connection method, and design features. Compare and contrast the different designs, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.
8. Presentation: Present and email the design report to the team, showcasing the different concepts, analysis results, and design justification.
